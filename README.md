# SOS_Alert_System
The project aims to enhance safety for victims by providing a simple SOS push button. When pressed, it sends a message with the victimâ€™s location and a help request to loved ones and the police. This solution can be integrated into smart watches, mobile covers, and other devices, using modern PCB design techniques to reduce costs.
